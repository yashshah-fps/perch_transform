## --- METRICS ---
# After you've defined the data source(s) you can define the metrics in the same file, or in a different .YAML file.

## There are three types of metrics. 
#    - measure_proxy: This proxies the measure you've defined :)! If you've defined create_metric: true in the data source, 
#                  this is the type of metric created.
#    - ratio: Divides two measures. You'll specify which is the numerator and which is the denominator.
#    - expr: Allows you to pass in any valid SQL expression
#---  # triple '-' is so that metric definitions are treated as separate YAML documents
#metric:
#  name: metric_name # enter in the name of the metric
#  description: Single line user-friendly description of the metric
#  owners: # A single or list of owners. We recommend team ownership
#    - owner@metricowner.com 
#  display_name: Display Name # How you want the metric to appear in the Transform UI
#  type: ratio # Ratio metrics divide two measures. The two measures must share common dimensions
#  type_params:
#    numerator: name_of_numerator_measure
#    denominator: name_of_denominator_measure
#  tier: n # One of the numbers 1, 2, or 3 to define the relative importance of the metric (1 is most important)

#metric:
#  name: metric_name # enter in the name of the metric
#  description:Â  |
#    Multiple line user-friendly description of the metric
#    Because sometimes more description is required.
#  owners: # single or list of owners.

#  type_params:
#    expr: # any valid SQL Expression. For Example: x - y + z
#    measures: # the measures used in the expression need to be called out explicitly
